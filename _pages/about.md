Biography
======
I am a PhD student in the Department of Electronic and Information Engineering at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. My supervisor is [Prof.Man-Wai Mak](http://www.eie.polyu.edu.hk/~mwmak/). My research interests include speaker recognition and multimodal semantic analysis.

I have received my master degree in Xinjiang Key Laboratory of Multilingual Information Technology at Xinjiang University. My supervisor is [Prof.Wushour Silamu](http://it.xju.edu.cn/info/1142/1361.htm), the Academician of Chinese Academy of Engineering. My research interests are Natural Language Processing(NLP), Multilingual public opinion analysis, especially Uyghur. I have been exploring some works related to Uyghur NLP since September 2018. I am working on NLP between both Low-Resource minority Languages (LRLs) and Morphologically Rich minority Languages (MRLs). I was working on identifying sensitive and harmful information in social media posts made in low resource languages (e.g., Uyghur).

In my master's study, I have won the Excellent Scientific and Technological Achievements Award of the Chinese Association for Artificial Intelligence. I have published five SCI papers, presented two papers at the EI conference and four Chinese core papers. I have been the principal investigator of a scientific research project and co-participant of several National Key R&D Program of China projects regarding Social Computing. I have presented an oral paper presentation at the 16th China Conference on Machine Translation.

Moreover, I am keen on addressing some NLP problems by exploiting Machine Learning and Deep Learning approaches. Presently, I spend most of my time on NLP tasks mainly on some interesting and meaningful problems for multimodal semantic understanding.
