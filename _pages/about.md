üë®‚Äçüéì Biography
======
I am currently a visiting PhD researcher at üá∫üá∏ [Stanford University](https://profiles.stanford.edu/332001). Additionally, I am pursuing my PhD at the üá≠üá∞ Hong Kong Polytechnic University. My supervisor is [Prof.Man-Wai Mak](http://www.eie.polyu.edu.hk/~mwmak/). My research focuses on robust speaker representation learning and machine learning.

I have received my master's degree in üá®üá≥ Xinjiang Key Laboratory of Multilingual Information Technology at Xinjiang University. My supervisor is [Prof. Wushour Silamu](http://it.xju.edu.cn/info/1142/1361.htm), the Academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering. My research interests are Natural Language Processing(NLP) and multilingual public opinion analysis, especially in Uyghur. I have been exploring some works related to Uyghur NLP since September 2018. I am working on NLP between Low-Resource minority Languages (LRLs) and Morphologically Rich minority Languages (MRLs). I was working on identifying sensitive and harmful information in social media posts made in low-resource languages (e.g., Uyghur).
